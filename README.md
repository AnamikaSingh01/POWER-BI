# IBM HR Analytics Dashboard

## Description

Here’s something about IBM: IBM (International Business Machines Corporation), nicknamed Big Blue, is an American multinational technology corporation headquartered in Armonk, New York and is present in over 175 countries. IBM is best known for producing and selling computer hardware and software, as well as cloud computing and data analytics. It is among the world’s largest employers, with over 297,900 employees worldwide in 2022.
Why I chose this project: Although this is a fictional dataset created by IBM data scientists (as claimed by the person who shared this data), I wanted to improve my dashboard creating and data analysis skill. Also this is the first time I did a project in this domain where I used my analytical skills to recommend strategies (see overall goal) based on the insights generated.
Overall Goal: “Recommend strategies to retain employee”
Questions: What is the average age of employees who left the company? What is the most common department for employees who left the company? What is the correlation between salary and attrition? What is the correlation between years of experience and attrition? What is the correlation between education level and attrition? What is the gender split of employee attrition? …etc.
